2007-01-29 (0.9.5):
	* Supports Flickr's new photo URL scheme (announced January 19, 2007):
	  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html
	
	  Flickr now requires API users to use the "originalsecret" and
	  "originalformat" to retrieve the original photo--when it is
	  accessible to the request maker (auth'ed or not) at all.
	
	  In order for this to work, you must supply an extra "extras"
	  parameter, set to "original_format", when you're calling
	  flickr.photo.search (the originalsecret will be returned back
	  along the way), for example:
	
	      f.call("flickr.photo.search", ..., :extras=>"original_format")
	
	  For more information on flickr.photo.search, please refer to 
	  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html
	  
	* :type key in module FlickrPhoto's helper methods is now
	  deprecated, replaced by :format for the sake of naming consistency.
	
	* The change of Flickr's photo URL scheme has the implication that
	  url_from_element_id, hash_from_element_id and element_id_from_hash
	  will not work correctly with original photos. I'm still 
	  considering encoding the extra originalformat and originalsecret
	  values in the element_id scheme, but I'm reluctant since it seems
	  that Flickr is doing its due to protect users' photos, which I
	  think is the right thing to do.


2007-01-08 (0.9.4):
    * Fixed a serious defect where API parameters, such as search text, 
      must be URL-escaped. There's a catch if you tried previously to use 
      CGI.escape to work around, though: Flickr's API signature string must
      not be *escaped* before the string is MD5-checksummed.
      
      Now everything should work fine. Pass a few CJKV or HTML entity 
      characters to see how it goes!


2007-01-04 (0.9.3):
    * These methods from FlickrPhoto are deprecated:
    
	  * FlickrPhoto.unique_id_from_hash(params, prefix)
	  * FlickrPhoto.url_from_unique_id(uid)
	  * FlickrPhoto.hash_from_unique_id(uid)
	  
	  Instead, please call them by these new names:
	  
	  * FlickrPhoto.element_id_from_hash(params, prefix)
	  * FlickrPhoto.url_from_element_id(uid)
	  * FlickrPhoto.hash_from_element_id(uid)
	  
	  This is for the sake of naming consistency. "Element id" is more 
	  web design talk. Henceforth the change.
	  

2006-12-27 (0.9.2):
	* Added support for Flickr's new "farm" part newly found in its photo URLs
	
	* Your code needs no change, everything will just work, including
	  those photo URL/div id helpers, but on the other hand...
	  
	* Deprecated methods in FlickrInvocation:

	  * photo_url(params)
	  * photo_div_id(params, prefix='photo')
	  * photo_url_from_div_id(uid)
	  * photo_info_from_div_id(uid)
	 
	  Those are methods that should never go into an invocation object.
	  Instead they belong to a helper, so:
	
	* Created a FlickrPhoto module

  	  FlickrPhoto.url_from_hash(params)
	  FlickrPhoto.unique_id_from_hash(params, prefix)
	  FlickrPhoto.url_from_unique_id(uid)
	  FlickrPhoto.hash_from_unique_id(uid)

	  Those helper functions now take place of their deprecated
	  predecessors.
	  
    * Before :server_id and :server were both accepted hash key
      for the "param" in those helper functions, now only :server
      is accepted. This is in accordance with Flickr's own
      naming convention.
      
    * You no longer need to set :auth=>true if you already supply
      an :auth_token parameter when you make Flickr method calls.
      Since :auth_token always implies that the call must be
      authenticated, ObjectiveFlickr is happy to save a few strokes
      for you. :)

	Added default_* methods into FlickrInvocation
	Removed History.txt

	
2006-12-10 (0.9.0):
